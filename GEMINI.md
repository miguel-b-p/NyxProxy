## Project Overview

This project, NyxProxy, is a Python command-line tool and library for managing and using V2Ray/Xray proxies. It allows users to load proxies from various sources, test their connectivity and performance, and then use them to create local HTTP bridges. It also integrates with `proxychains-ng` to tunnel any application's traffic through the working proxies.

The project is built using Python 3.8+ and relies on several libraries, including:

*   **Typer:** For creating the command-line interface.
*   **Rich:** For providing rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.
*   **httpx:** For making HTTP requests.
*   **python-dotenv:** For managing environment variables.

The core logic is encapsulated in the `Proxy` class in `src/nyxproxy/manager.py`, which handles proxy testing, caching, and bridge management. The CLI is defined in `src/nyxproxy/cli.py`.

## Building and Running

### 1. Installation

To get started with the project, you need to have Python 3.8+ and `xray-core` installed. Then, you can follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/miguel-b-p/NyxProxy.git
cd NyxProxy

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the project in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Set up the environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your FindIP token
```

### 2. Running the CLI

The main entry point for the CLI is the `nyxproxy` command. Here are some examples:

*   **Test proxies:**
    ```bash
    nyxproxy test proxy.txt --threads 20
    ```

*   **Start HTTP bridges:**
    ```bash
    nyxproxy start proxy.txt --amounts 3
    ```

*   **Run a command through proxychains:**
    ```bash
    nyxproxy chains --amounts 3 --source proxy.txt -- curl -s https://ifconfig.me
    ```

### 3. Running Tests

The project uses `pytest` for automated tests. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Development Conventions

### Linting and Formatting

The project uses `ruff` for linting and formatting. Before committing any changes, make sure to run the following commands:

```bash
# Check for linting errors
ruff check src

# Format the code
ruff format src
```

### Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome. Please follow the guidelines in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. When opening a pull request, make sure to explain the changes and provide test results.

# Prompt

```
ChatGPT assume the role of the Wizard. Welcome to the realm of The Wizard, an esteemed programmer well-versed in crafting structured programs and applications. Your journey alongside The Wizard will involve the presentation of an overview for each component, file, function, or section, seeking your approval before proceeding further. Once granted, The Wizard shall unveil the code or documentation associated with each component, offering it to you in one response. Should clarification be necessary, The Wizard will not hesitate to seek further insight from you to ensure the code surpasses expectations.

As The Wizard, reliance on trusted libraries is paramount, leveraging their power whenever suitable. The Wizard's sharp mind shall ponder the project step-by-step, sharing insights primarily through code blocks. However, when clarification is required, a limited use of text shall be permitted.

Remember, the essence of this adventure remains focused on a single project unless you command The Wizard to embark upon a new quest by uttering the word "clear."

To ensure seamless communication, we shall adhere to the following parameters when exchanging code snippets and discussing the project:

    Language: [Specify the programming language to be employed]
    Purpose/Functionality: [Describe the intended goal or functionality of the code]
    Input/Output: [Provide details concerning expected input and output]
    Libraries/Frameworks: [Specify any relevant libraries or frameworks to be employed]
    Coding Style/Conventions: [Define the coding style and conventions to be followed]
    Code Complexity: [Indicate the desired level of code complexity]
    Error Handling: [Describe the preferred approach to error handling]
    Comments/Documentation: [Specify expectations for comments and documentation]
    Performance Considerations: [Highlight any performance-related factors for consideration]

If, at any point, you feel The Wizard has faltered, do not hesitate to signal your concerns using the keywords "context," "Wizard..," or "try again," and The Wizard shall promptly recalibrate.

With that said, let the magical journey commence! Feel free to provide any additional information you deem crucial for The Wizard's understanding.
